# Anti-Theft_Vehicle_Tracking_System
The vehicle tracking system built in this project works using GSM & GPS modules. The 
project is based on Arduino UNO. The GPS module is connected to its own antenna. The 
antenna of the GPS locks the satellite at a location and gives the location. The GSM module 
has its own antenna which connects it to the 2G network and aids in sending SMS via the sim
present in the module.
